    "aboutMe": "FE developer with BE skills. In my career I have attended several computer science and software engineering courses, I have had various experiences in IT but I always try to keep up to date and learn new technologies. I practiced the entire software lifecycle, from requirements discussions with customers to UI and UX analysis and processing up to the release and maintenance. I have strong knowledge of java, html, css and javascript/Typescript and currently I work with single page applications framework and my basic tech stack includes React.js/Next.js + Typescript, Node, Redux Toolkit or AngularJS but in the past i used also some html template engines like Pug / Jade. I have experiences with CMS integrations such as Magnolia CMS, Open CMS, Wordpress and Adobe Experience Manager, working with Docker and CI/CD deployment (Gitlab), data visualization tools (D3.js or others), and using maps (Google Maps API)."
